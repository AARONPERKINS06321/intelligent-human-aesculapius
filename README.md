# intelligent-human-aesculapius

A research project exploring a multimodal AI medical assistant capable of handling voice, vision and diagnostic reasoning. The goal is to provide a single assistant that can understand spoken questions, analyze images such as X-rays, and offer tentative diagnostic suggestions. Development is in early stages and this repository serves as a starting point for collaboration.

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a demonstration assistant with capabilities in:

* **Voice input and output** - Accept patient or physician questions via audio and produce synthesized spoken answers.
* **Vision analysis** - Process medical images, e.g. radiology scans, to help inform diagnostic reasoning.
* **Reasoning engine** - Combine natural language and visual understanding to generate possible diagnoses or next steps.

This repository currently contains placeholder code and documentation. As new features are implemented, additional modules and demonstrations will be added.

## Installation and Basic Usage

At the moment there is no packaged release. Clone the repository and install any required dependencies manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-human-aesculapius.git
cd intelligent-human-aesculapius
# Install dependencies as required
```

After installation, run the demonstration scripts included in the repo. Example usage will be expanded as the project grows.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To get started:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Commit your changes with clear messages.
3. Open a pull request describing your contribution.

Please ensure any code you contribute follows standard Python formatting conventions and includes tests where appropriate. Feel free to open issues for discussion or feature requests.

### Future Plans

Future development ideas include:

* Improved natural language understanding and conversation flow.
* Integration with common medical imaging formats.
* A web-based demonstration interface.

These plans may evolve as the project and community involvement grows. Check the issue tracker for up‑to‑date tasks and priorities.
